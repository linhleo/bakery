        <p>
          Linh Bakery was founded in 2020 by Linh Nguyen. She has nurtured her
          passion for baking since she was far away from her home country and
          had to learn how to bake some Asian special cakes for herself. After
          being awarded a Marketing Bachelor degree from The University of
          Wollongong in 2019, she decided to leave her academic career behind
          and started doing something that she was really into. After hundreds
          of failures in her home kitchen, Linh has eventually come up with many
          creative delicious baking recipes which satisfy people from different
          cultures: Aussies, Asian, European,...and is proud to open her very
          first bakery in Australia. Besides Western cakes, she also introduces
          many special Asian cakes to bring Asian cuisine beyond just savoury
          meals. Whether you are a foreigner wanting to try Asian baking style,
          or an Asian missing your Mom's cakes, you are more than welcome here.
          Our cakes are baked with lots of love, pride and caring.
